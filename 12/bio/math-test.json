It may\nbe very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of\nbeauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a\nbeautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising\none when we read it. — G. H. HARDY v\n\n1.1  Introduction\nRecall that the notion of relations and functions, domain,\nco-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI\nalong with different types of specific real valued functions\nand their graphs. The concept of the term ‘relation’ in\nmathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation\nin English language, according to which two objects or\nquantities are related if there is a recognisable connection\nor link between the two objects or quantities. Let  A be\nthe set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the\nset of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some\nof the examples of relations from A to B are\n(i)\n{(a, b) ∈A × B: a is brother of b},\n(ii)\n{(a, b) ∈A × B: a is sister of b},\n(iii)\n{(a, b) ∈A × B: age of a is greater than age of b},\n(iv)\n{(a, b) ∈A × B: total marks obtained by a in the final examination is less than\nthe total marks obtained by b in the final examination},\n(v)\n{(a, b) ∈ A × B: a lives in the same locality as b}.  However, abstracting from\nthis, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset\nof A × B.\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as\na R b. In general, (a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable\nconnection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of\nrelations.\nIn this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition\nof functions, invertible functions and binary operations.\n\nChapter 1\n\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n\nLejeune Dirichlet\n (1805-1859)\n\nReprint 2025-26",

Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by\nR = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions.\n\nDefinition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A.\n\nDefinition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A\nis related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.\n\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial\nrelations.\n\nExample 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.\n\nSolution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\nless than 3 meters. This shows that R′ = A × A is the universal relation.\n\nRemark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster\nmethod and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R\n= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.\n\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.\n\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three\ntypes of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\n\nDefinition 3 A relation R in a set A is called\n\n(i)\nreflexive, if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,\n\n(ii)\nsymmetric, if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that (a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A.\n\n(iii)\ntransitive, if (a1, a2) ∈ R and (a2, a3) ∈ R implies that (a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2,\na3 ∈ A.\n\nReprint 2025-26",
