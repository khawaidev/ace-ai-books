  "unit_overview": "As you are aware, humans are sexually reproducing and\nviviparous. The reproductive events in humans include\nformation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males\nand ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female\ngenital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female\ngametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This\nis followed by formation and development of blastocyst\nand its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation),\nembryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the\nbaby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive\nevents occur after puberty. There are remarkable\ndifferences between the reproductive events in the male\nand in the female, for example, sperm formation continues\neven in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women\naround the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and\nfemale reproductive systems in human.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\n2.1\nThe Male Reproductive\nSystem\n\n2.2\nThe Female Reproductive\nSystem\n\n2.3\nGametogenesis\n\n2.4\nMenstrual Cycle\n\n2.5\nFertilisation and\nImplantation\n\n2.6\nPregnancy and Embryonic\nDevelopment\n\n2.7\nParturition and Lactation\n\nReprint 2025-26",

      "content": "The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region\n(Figure 2.1a). It includes a pair of testes alongwith\naccessory ducts, glands and the external genitalia.\n\nThe testes are situated outside the\nabdominal cavity within a pouch\ncalled scrotum. The scrotum helps\nin maintaining the low temperature\nof the testes (2â€“2.5o C lower than\nthe normal internal body\ntemperature) necessary for\nspermatogenesis. In adults, each\ntestis is oval in shape, with a length\nof about 4 to 5 cm and a width of\nabout 2 to 3 cm. The testis is\ncovered by a dense covering. Each\ntestis has about 250 compartments\ncalled \ntesticular \nlobules\n(Figure 2.1b).\nEach lobule contains one to\nthree highly coiled seminiferous\ntubules in which sperms are\nproduced. Each seminiferous tubule\nis lined on its inside by two types\nof cells called male germ cells\n(spermatogonia) and Sertoli cells\n(Figure 2.2 ). The male germ cells\nundergo meiotic divisions finally\nleading to sperm formation, while\nSertoli cells provide nutrition to the\ngerm cells. The regions outside the\nseminiferous tubules called\ninterstitial spaces, contain small\nblood vessels and interstitial cells\nor Leydig cells (Figure 2.2). Leydig\ncells synthesise and secrete\ntesticular \nhormones \ncalled\nandrogens. Other  immunologically\ncompetent cells are also present.\nThe male sex accessory ducts include rete testis, vasa efferentia,\nepididymis and vas deferens (Figure 2.1b). The seminiferous tubules of\nthe testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia\nleave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface\nof each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the\nabdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal\nvesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 2.1a). These\nducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through\nurethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends\nthrough the penis to its external opening called urethral meatus.\n\nFigure 2.1(a) Diagrammatic sectional view of male pelvis\nshowing reproductive system\n\nFigure 2.1(b) Diagrammatic view of male reproductive system\n(part of testis is open to show inner details)\n\n27\n\nHUMAN REPRODUCTION\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nThe penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 2.1a, b). It is made up\nof special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.\nThe enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold\nof skin called foreskin.\nThe male accessory glands (Figure 2.1a, b) include paired seminal\nvesicles, a prostate and paired bulbourethral glands. Secretions of these\nglands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium\nand certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps\nin the lubrication of the penis."
