Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by\nR = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions.\n\nDefinition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A.\n\nDefinition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A\nis related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.\n\nBoth the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial\nrelations.\n\nExample 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.\n\nSolution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\nless than 3 meters. This shows that R′ = A × A is the universal relation.\n\nRemark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster\nmethod and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R\n= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.\n\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.\n\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three\ntypes of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\n\nDefinition 3 A relation R in a set A is called\n\n(i)\nreflexive, if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,\n\n(ii)\nsymmetric, if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that (a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A.\n\n(iii)\ntransitive, if (a1, a2) ∈ R and (a2, a3) ∈ R implies that (a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2,\na3 ∈ A.\n\nReprint 2025-26",

Show that R is an equivalence relation.\n\nSolution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further,\n(T1, T2) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 ⇒ T2 is congruent to T1 ⇒ (T2, T1) ∈ R. Hence,\nR is symmetric. Moreover, (T1, T2), (T2, T3) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is  congruent to T2 and T2 is\ncongruent to T3 ⇒ T1 is congruent to T3 ⇒ (T1, T3) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence\nrelation.\n\nExample 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as\nR = {(L1, L2) : L1 is perpendicular to L2}.

R is symmetric as (L1, L2) ∈ R\n⇒\nL1 is perpendicular to L2\n⇒\nL2 is perpendicular to L1\n⇒\n(L2, L1) ∈ R.\n\nR is not transitive. Indeed, if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and\nL2 is perpendicular to L3, then L1 can never be perpendicular to\nL3. In fact, L1 is parallel to L3, i.e., (L1, L2) ∈ R, (L2, L3) ∈ R but (L1, L3) ∉ R.\n\nExample 4 Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),\n(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.\n\nSolution R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,\nas (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly, R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R\nbut (1, 3) ∉ R.\n\nExample 5 Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by\n\nR = {(a, b) : 2 divides a – b}\n\nis an equivalence relation.\n\nSolution R is reflexive, as 2 divides (a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further, if (a, b) ∈ R, then\n2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is\nsymmetric. Similarly, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by\n2. Now, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, (a – c) is divisible by 2. This\nshows that R is transitive.

Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. Note that\n[0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2r] and [1] = [2r + 1], r ∈ Z. Infact, what we have seen above is true\nfor an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence\nrelation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called\npartitions or subdivisions  of X satisfying:\n\n(i)\nall elements of Ai are related to each other, for all i.\n\n(ii)\nno element of Ai is related to any element of Aj , i ≠ j.\n\n(iii)\n∪ Aj = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ, i ≠ j.\n\nThe subsets Ai are called equivalence classes.

Following the\narguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Also, A1 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A2\ncoincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A3 coincides with the\nset of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A1 = [0], A2 = [1] and A3 = [2].\nIn fact, A1 = [3r], A2 = [3r + 1] and A3 = [3r + 2], for all r ∈ Z.\n\nExample 6 Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by\nR = {(a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}.

As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and\namong other  disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from\nwhere we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of\nfunctions.\n\nConsider the functions  f1, f2, f3 and f4 given by the following diagrams.\n\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X1 under the function\nf1 are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X1 under f2 is same,\nnamely b. Further, there are some elements like e and f in X2 which are not images of\nany element of X1 under f1, while all elements of X3 are images of some elements of X1\nunder f3. The above observations lead to the following definitions:\n\nDefinition 5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective), if the images\nof distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x1, x2 ∈ X, f(x1) = f(x2)\nimplies x1 = x2. Otherwise, f is called many-one.\n\nThe function f1 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f2 and f3\nin Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.\n\nDefinition 6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element\nof Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an\nelement x in X such that f (x) = y.\n\nThe function f3 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f1 in Fig 1.2 (i) is\nnot onto as elements e, f in X2 are not the image of any element in X1 under f1.\n\nReprint 2025-26",

Similarly, the possibility of x1 being\neven and x2 being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,\nboth x1 and x2 must be either odd or even. Suppose both x1 and x2 are odd. Then\nf (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 + 1 = x2 + 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Similarly, if both x1 and x2 are even, then also\nf (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 – 1 = x2 – 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Thus, f is one-one. Also, any odd number\n2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2r + 2 in the domain N and any even number\n2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2r – 1 in the domain N. Thus, f is onto.\n\nExample 13 Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one.\n\nSolution Suppose f is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the\ndomain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of 3 under f can be\nonly one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the\nco-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f  is not onto, a contradiction. Hence, f must be one-one.\n\nExample 14 Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto.\n\nSolution Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different\nelements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f. Hence, f has to be onto.\n\nRemark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary\nfinite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map\nf : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X.

The function g is called the inverse of f  and\nis denoted by f –1.\n\nThus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is\none-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a\nfunction f to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the\nactual inverse of f is not to be determined.\n\nExample 17 Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f (x) = 4x + 3, where,\nY = {y ∈ N: y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N}.

Further, (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence (u, v) R (x, y). This\nshows that R is symmetric.

      "text": "RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n17\n\n—v—\n\nHistorical Note\nThe concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from\nR. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript\n“Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x\nwhile studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James\nGregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura”\n(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by\nsuccessive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W.\nLeibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu  de\nfunctionibus” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying\nfrom point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the\nslope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However,\nin his manuscript “Historia” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean\nquantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function\nof x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φx for the first time in 1718 to\nindicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to\nrepresent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first\npart of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange\n(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques” in\n1793, where he discussed  about analytic function and used the notion f (x), F(x),\nφ(x) etc. for different function of x. Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet\n(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set\ntheoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was\ndeveloped by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function\nknown to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet\nin a rigorous manner.\n\nReprint 2025-26",
