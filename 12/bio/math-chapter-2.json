There are many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and hence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their inverses do not exist. In this chapter, we shall study about the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and observe their behaviour through graphical representations. Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.  \n\nThe inverse trigonometric functions play an important role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals. The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.",

      "text": "**2.2 Basic Concepts**  \n\nIn Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:  \nsine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1]  \ncosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1]  \n\ntangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2n + 1) π/2 , n ∈ Z} → R  \n\ncotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R  \n\nsecant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2n + 1) π/2 , n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)  \n\ncosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ,  n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)  \n\nWe have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : X→Y such that f (x) = y is one-one and onto, then we can define a unique function g : Y→X such that g(y) = x, where x ∈ X and y = f (x), y ∈ Y. Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g = domain of f. The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f⁻¹. Further, g is also one-one and onto and inverse of g is f. Thus, g⁻¹ = (f⁻¹)⁻¹ = f. We also have (f⁻¹ o f ) (x) = f⁻¹ (f (x)) = f⁻¹(y) = x and (f o f⁻¹) (y) = f (f⁻¹(y)) = f (x) = y.  \n\nSince the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the closed interval [–1, 1]. If we restrict its domain to [–π/2, π/2], then it becomes one-one and onto with range [– 1, 1]. Actually, sine function restricted to any of the intervals [–3π/2, –π/2], [–π/2, π/2], [π/2, 3π/2] etc., is one-one and its range is [–1, 1]. We can, therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals. We denote the inverse of sine function by sin⁻¹ (arc sine function). Thus, sin⁻¹ is a function whose domain is [– 1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals [–3π/2, –π/2], [–π/2, π/2] or [π/2, 3π/2], and so on. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function sin⁻¹. The branch with range [–π/2, π/2] is called the principal value branch, whereas other intervals as range give different branches of sin⁻¹. When we refer to the function sin⁻¹, we take it as the function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range is [–π/2, π/2]. We write sin⁻¹ : [–1, 1] → [–π/2, π/2].  \n\nFrom the definition of the inverse functions, it follows that sin (sin⁻¹ x) = x if – 1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and sin⁻¹ (sin x) = x if –π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2. In other words, if y = sin⁻¹ x, then sin y = x.",

      "text": "**Remarks**  \n\n(i) We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f(x) is an invertible function, then x = f⁻¹ (y). Thus, the graph of sin⁻¹ function can be obtained from the graph of original function by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if (a, b) is a point on the graph of sine function, then (b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function y = sin⁻¹ x can be obtained from the graph of y = sin x by interchanging x and y axes. The graphs of y = sin x and y = sin⁻¹ x are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii). The dark portion of the graph of y = sin⁻¹ x represent the principal value branch.  \n\n(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along the line y = x. This can be visualised by looking the graphs of y = sin x and y = sin⁻¹ x as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii)).  \n\n**Figure 2.1 (i): Graph of y = sin x**  \n*Explanation:* This graph shows the standard sine function, a periodic wave with period 2π. The x-axis represents the angle in radians, marked from -2π to 2π. The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1. The curve starts at x = -2π, y = 0, rises to a peak at x = -3π/2, y = -1 (wait, no: sine is odd and periodic). Standard points: at x = 0, y = 0; x = π/2, y = 1; x = π, y = 0; x = 3π/2, y = -1; x = 2π, y = 0. It oscillates smoothly between y = -1 and y = 1, with no asymptotes. The graph is continuous and smooth, repeating every 2π.  \n\n**Figure 2.1 (ii): Graph of y = sin⁻¹ x**  \n*Explanation:* This graph shows the inverse sine function (principal branch). The x-axis ranges from -1 to 1 (domain), and the y-axis from -π/2 to π/2 (range). The curve is odd and increasing: it starts at x = -1, y = -π/2; passes through x = 0, y = 0; and ends at x = 1, y = π/2. It is a smooth, concave-down curve in the first quadrant and concave-up in the third (mirrored). The dark portion highlights the principal branch, emphasizing the restricted range.  \n\n**Figure 2.1 (iii): Graphs of y = sin x and y = sin⁻¹ x in the same axes**  \n*Explanation:* This combined graph overlays y = sin x (sine wave, oscillating) and y = sin⁻¹ x (S-shaped curve from (-1, -π/2) to (1, π/2)) on the same coordinate system. It illustrates the reflection property: the graph of sin⁻¹ x is the reflection of sin x over the line y = x (within the restricted domain). Key points like (π/2, 1) on sin x become (1, π/2) on sin⁻¹ x. The sine wave extends beyond [-1,1] on y, but the inverse is limited.",

Actually, cosine function restricted to any of the intervals [– π, 0], [0,π], [π, 2π] etc., is bijective with range as [–1, 1]. We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by cos⁻¹ (arc cosine function).

      "text": "**2.3 Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions**  \n\nIn this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse trigonometric functions. In fact, they will be valid only for some values of x for which inverse trigonometric functions are defined. We will not go into the details of these values of x in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook.  \n\nLet us recall that if y = sin⁻¹x, then x = sin y and if x = sin y, then y = sin⁻¹x. This is equivalent to sin (sin⁻¹ x) = x, x ∈ [– 1, 1] and sin⁻¹ (sin x) = x, x ∈ [–π/2, π/2].  \n\nFor suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric functions.  \n\nWe now consider some examples.  \n\n**Example 3** Show that  \n(i) sin⁻¹ (2x√(1 – x²)) = 2 sin⁻¹ x, –1/√2 ≤ x ≤ 1/√2  \n(ii) sin⁻¹ (2x√(1 – x²)) = 2 cos⁻¹ x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/√2  \n\n**Solution**  \n(i) Let x = sin θ. Then sin⁻¹ x = θ. We have sin⁻¹ (2x√(1 – x²)) = sin⁻¹ (2 sin θ cos θ) = sin⁻¹ (sin 2θ) = 2θ = 2 sin⁻¹ x  \n(ii) Take x = cos θ, then proceeding as above, we get, sin⁻¹ (2x√(1 – x²)) = 2 cos⁻¹ x  \n\n**Example 4** Express tan⁻¹ (cos x / (1 – sin x)), –π/2 < x < π/2 in the simplest form.  \n\n**Solution** We write  \ntan⁻¹ (cos x / (1 – sin x)) = tan⁻¹ [(cos x (1 + sin x)) / ((1 – sin x)(1 + sin x))] = tan⁻¹ [(cos x (1 + sin x)) / (1 – sin² x)] = tan⁻¹ [(cos x (1 + sin x)) / cos² x] = tan⁻¹ [(1 + sin x) / cos x] = tan⁻¹ [1/cos x + sin x/cos x] = tan⁻¹ [sec x + tan x].  \nLet θ = tan⁻¹ [sec x + tan x], then tan θ = sec x + tan x. Using identity, we get θ = π/4 + x/2. Thus, tan⁻¹ (cos x / (1 – sin x)) = π/4 + x/2.  \n\n**Example 5** Write cot⁻¹ (1 / √(x² – 1)), x > 1 in the simplest form.  \n\n**Solution** Let x = sec θ, then √(x² – 1) = tan θ. Therefore, cot⁻¹ (1 / √(x² – 1)) = cot⁻¹ (cot θ) = θ = sec⁻¹ x, which is the simplest form.",

But 3π/5 ∉ [–π/2, π/2], which is the principal value branch of sin⁻¹ x. However, sin (3π/5) = sin (π – 3π/5) = sin (2π/5) and 2π/5 ∈ [–π/2, π/2].

In fact (sin x)⁻¹ = 1/sin x and similarly for other trigonometric functions.  \n- The value of an inverse trigonometric function which lies in its principal value branch is called the principal value of that inverse trigonometric function.  \n\n**Historical Note**  \n\nThe study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.  \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to mathematics.  \n\nBhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., were given by Bhaskara II.  \n\nThe symbols sin⁻¹ x, cos⁻¹ x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813). The name of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios:  \nH/S = h/s  \nthat is, H = h × S/s. This is known as the principle of similarity. The Greeks were not aware of this and used the 'method of shadows' which was essentially the same.  \n\nIn the sixteenth century, the method of triangulation was perfected and was used in land surveying. The modern approach to trigonometry deals with the study of trigonometric functions as functions of real numbers.",

      "text": "**A Note to the Reader**  \n\nInverse trigonometric functions are also termed as 'arc functions'. For example,  \n- sin⁻¹ x can be interpreted as the length of the arc whose sine is x  \n- cos⁻¹ x can be interpreted as the length of the arc whose cosine is x, and so on  \n\nThese functions find extensive application in calculus, particularly in integration of functions involving trigonometric expressions. The properties discussed in this chapter will be particularly useful when studying techniques of integration in higher mathematics.",
